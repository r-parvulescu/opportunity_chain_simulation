# opportunity_chain_simulation
MESA agent-based model simulating organisational mobility/an internal labour market

This is an implementation of an agent-based model of mobility in hierarchical organisations,
inspired by Harrison White's "Chains of Opportunity" (1970) and social sequence analysis,
distilled in "Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Application" (2015) by Benjamin Cornwell.
