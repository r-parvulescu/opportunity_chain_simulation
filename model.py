    This model implements abstract occupational mobility in an equally abstract hierarchical organisation.
    The organisation is populated by two types of agents, vacancies and actors, each moving across positions.
    Only one actor OR one vacancy can be the dual (i.e. occupy) a position at any given point. No position
    can be devoid of duals. Actors can only choose to move when they're at the top level of the hierarchy: in
    this case they retire. When actors retire, they call a vacancy from outside the system and put it in their
    former place. Vacancies can only move down the hierarchy. When moving vacancies pick a position, and if this
    position is not already desired by another (vacancy) then our vacancy swaps places with the actor occupying
    the desired position. In this way, an actor moves up the hierarchy whenever a vacancy moves down. Finally,
    if a vacancy is in the bottom level and moves down it "retires", calling in an actor from outside the system
    and putting them in its former position.
